# Welcome to Bosca Ceoil Blue Docs!

_[bús-ka kyó-al] — a music box._

**Bosca Ceoil: The Blue Album** (or _Bosca Ceoil Blue_, for short) is a simple and beginner-friendly app for making music. Using a step sequencer you can create anything from a simple beat to a complex melodic piece — with huge selection of synthesized instruments at your disposal!

The best place to start learning about _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ and its features is the [Overview](/overview.html) page.

## Version compatibility

_Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is available as a [download for all desktop platforms](https://yurisizov.itch.io/boscaceoil-blue) and [directly in your browser](https://humnom.net/apps/boscaceoil/beta/). The functionality of either version is identical, so this documentation covers both of them. If for whatever reason there is a notable difference in behavior between the desktop and the browser version, it will be stated explicitly.

The hosted version of this documentation covers functionality of the most recent stable release. Older versions can be viewed via GitHub (e.g., [version 3.1](https://github.com/YuriSizov/boscaceoil-blue/tree/3.1-stable/docs)), including pre-release versions.

Versions prior to 3.0 (i.e. original _Bosca Ceoil_) are not covered by this documentation, however general concepts of _Bosca Ceoil_ remain unchanged and you can loosely apply the information found here to any version.


## Available languages

_Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is available in **English**, and so is this documentation. If you have made a tutorial or an overview of the app in your native language, please feel free to add a link to it to the [Community](/community.html) page.
