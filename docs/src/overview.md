## Bosca Ceoil, a step sequencer

At its core, _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is a simple musical sequencer. You compose music that is laid out perfectly on a fixed grid. Each cell on this grid represents a unit in time, the minimum length that the played sound can be. We call this _a note_, a 1-unit-long note to be precise. A number of these unit notes in a row form the length of _a pattern_.

Patterns is what your overall song consists of. You arrange patterns across _the timeline_, the timeline that is also split into cells, fitting exactly one pattern. Chain enough patterns together, and you have _a composition_! Every pattern has _an instrument_ assigned to it, and there are 8 _tracks_ for patterns to be played at the same time â€” giving you flexibility to build up layers to your compositions.

That's the basic principle of making songs with _Bosca Ceoil_. Don't worry if it's too much to grasp at this point, we'll go through each part in this and follow-up articles. Now, let's take a look at the user interface to assign these ideas to the tools at your disposal!

The whole user interface can be split into two main areas, the upper _tool view_ and the lower _pattern view_.

- The upper view has changeable panels, accessible with the menu at the very top of the application window. Each panel gives you access to a different set of tools and configuration options.
- The pattern view is always visible and allows you to edit the current pattern at any time.
