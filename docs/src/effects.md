# Effects and filters

While individual instruments only allow you to configure a low-pass filter to adjust their sound, a variety of more interesting effects can be applied to the song overall. You can find these extra effects and filters in the `ADVANCED` view.

## Global effects

The following effects are available to you:

- Delay
- Chorus
- Reverb
- Distortion
- Low boost
- Compressor
- High pass

Only one of these effects can be applied at the same time.

Typically, many of these effects allow for a very granular control via a number of settings. For the sake of simplicity, in _Bosca Ceoil_ you can enable and adjust the power of each effect and filter with just one slider. Setting the slider all the way to the left disables all global effects.


## Swing effect

Separate from other effects is _swing_. Using _swing_ you can adjust the timing of the played notes. Normally, a note in _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ can be played at every tick of the metronome. The swing effect takes two consecutive notes in a pattern and adjusts their proportions, such that one of the notes takes the majority of their combined time and the other takes the minority.

In other words, if two notes take _two ticks_ to play, then adjusting the swing effect to the left makes the first note take the smaller portion of those two ticks, and the second note â€” to take the larger portion. Moving the slider to the right does the opposite, and the first note takes the larger portion.
